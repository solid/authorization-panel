## Minutes

### Brief update on Interop Authorization related work

- Justin B: explaining interop panel relation to WAC
- Pavlik: Brings up [Handle User-Focused Client Constraining Access Control via the ACL #68](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/68)

### How to approach requirements from WAC-UCR

Justin B: start the requirements section. 
 + Are we ready?
 + should we do that?
 + should we start working on a proposal of how authorisation should work for the use cases
- Elf Pavlik:
  the use cases are currently so granular that it seems that they could map 1 to 1 to requirements
- Henry: How will requirements section differ? Perhaps examples of requirements would be helpful
- Justin B: Requirements are an abstraction layer over scenarios. One Requirement can group together a number of scenarios, and would be easier to refer to.
- Sarven: we agreed to have a way of tracking the interest in various use cases, and I promised to put a document up so that people can express their interest, allowing the panel to evaluate priorities. We should also acknowledge differences in where content is published and who has control over it ([see issue 89](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/89). (what was the last point?). Are these use cases for WAC or an extended WAC?

Elf Pavlik - Notes that we'll move to project management scenario examples in interop, and those could translate here.

Action Item: Sarven to create a document for people to vote for use cases
