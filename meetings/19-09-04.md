# 2019-09-04 Solid App Authorization Panel

## Success Criteria

https://github.com/solid/app-authorization-panel#success-criteria

- Jackson: taking inspiration from how things work in Data Interoperability Panel

- An app can request access to a specific type of data without knowing the structure of resources on a Pod
  - Jackson: I think PRP proposal may not handle it
  - zenomt: my proposal can handle that as well
- Access requests can be sent when the user is not present to be approved once the user is present
  - Jackson: I see it needed for bot's
  - Pavlik: I understand it as the person already has access to resource  but want to use bot to interact with it
  - Jackson: Some use cases would require approval
  - zenomt: PRP proposal addresses it
  - Jacskon: we should discuss what resource owner can do
  - Pavlik: we should clarify that we call 'resource owner' the agent who has change access to the resource
  - Pavlik: clarifying where agent has read or write access but not changel and wants to restrict which apps can use that access
- It should be possible to block/allow certain apps from accessing a specific resource
  - zenomt: I imagine that identity of app stays bound to the token use as bearer, OP puts for example redirect url in id token
  - Pavlik: We have issue for identifying apps - https://github.com/solid/app-authorization-panel/issues/30
  - Jackson: if I share resource with a person I trust in their choice of apps
  - zenomt: user has to stay 'ok' for app before allowing access

- zenomt: PRP includes some envisioned use cases, it can input into success criterias / use cases
- zenomt: i have concern about ACL, and what we discuss can add more dimintionality to the problem - speaking in database terms
- zenomt: we discussed with Dmitri on one way of partitioning resources depending on what app I want to use, https://gitter.im/solid/app-authorization-panel?at=5d684659bee75051a41c2d7f
- zenomt: we probably cant represent everything in single ACL document
- Henry: we need a way to extend current ACL rules, describe sets of agents, sets of resources, problems come with defining those rules and how to verify them

## Privilege Request Protocol

https://github.com/solid/app-authorization-panel/blob/master/privilege-request-protocol.md

- zenomt: Ruben proposed alternative based on LDN this weekend, where the client knows exactly what it wants to ask for and request specific change from RS
- Jackson: it will require creating vocab to communicate those requests
- Jackson: can we consider PRP proposal and Ruben's LDN based as equivalent?
- zenomt: i see it as compleately different way of thinking about the problem, i see it semantically and operationally different
- zenomt: Ruben's proposal uses things that currently exist in Solid

## App Authorization Management (Granting, Changing, and Revoking)
