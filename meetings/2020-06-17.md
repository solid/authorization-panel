## Minutes

### [Clarify purpose of this panel #70](https://github.com/solid/authorization-and-access-control-panel/issues/70)

- Jackson: I recall that we considered WAC as set in stone.
- Justin: Aaron submited a lot of issues pointing out amibiguities. We also have proposals to exted it like taggin from Michel.
- ...: I see original purpose to narrow. New one needs to cover WAC and access requests.
- Pavlik: I think taking look at initiatives can help us clarify how broad purpose do we need.

### [Prioritize initiatives for the panel #72](https://github.com/solid/authorization-and-access-control-panel/issues/72)

- Justin: It's based on minutes from previous week. It also incorporates some perspectives from editorial meetings. TimBL agrees that we need normative WAC draft.

- Pavlik: Should include an initiatize for requesting access (see ruben's proposal and the ecosystem proposal by interop panel). *Noted in the github issue*.
