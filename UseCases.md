# Application Authorization Use Cases

![ecosystem diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solid/app-authorization-panel/master/images/app-auth-uc.png)

 - Alice uses https://simplegame.example to play a singleplayer game
    - Simplegame only needs some file somewhere that it can write its own configuration to. It does not care where it is
    - Simpleapp will also need to access this file again even if it’s being used on another machine
 - Alice uses https://chat.o.team to chat with her friends
    - OChat wants to gain access to all chat related data
    - Wants access to chat related data that was created after it asked for permission to read them
    - Wants to be alerted when new chat related data has been added to the Pod
    - Wants to create chat related data
- Alice uses iSay deployed on https://isay.alice.example/ to participate in discussion boards
  - She wants to trust iSay to access any discussion boards, including
    - Discussions on https://alice.example/
    - Discussions on https://acme.example/
    - Discussion on https://yoyodyne.example/
  - She wants to receive push notifications on devices she uses when someone replies to discussion she participates in - iSay inculdes a remote client component which provides that feature.
  - Alice, ACME and Yoyodyne want to allow each person with access to discussion boards on their resource servers to decide which applications they trust to participate in those discussions.
  - Alice only wants to allow iSay to access discussions to avoid other apps (eg. games) she tries to have any way of posting spam messges in any of those discussions
 - Alice uses https://doctorChat.example to chat with her doctor
    - DoctorChat wants to create chat related data specifically about medical information
    - DoctorChat wants to ensure Alice has given explicit consent to view the chats that it created before other apps can view this data
 - Alice uses https://edit.o.team to edit her raw RDF
    - OEdit wants to be able to read and write to a file at a specific location
 - Alice uses https://admin.example to control her pod
    - Admin wants to be able to read and write to all files on a user’s Pod
 - Alice uses https://decentPhotos.example to view her photos and her friend Bob’s photos
    - Decent photos wants to read to all photos on Alice’s Pod
    - Wants to read all photos on Bob’s Pod that Alice has access to
 - Alice uses https://photoOrganizer.example to organize the photos on her Pod
    - PhotoOrganizer wants to read and write only photos
    - Wants to understand the folder structure of the Pod
    - Wants to modify the folder structure of the Pod
 - Alice uses FaceDetectionCronJob to crawl over her photos and Bob’s photos at night and produce facial recognition data
    - FaceDetectionCronJob is not an application and will need access to photos even when Alice is not actively using it
    - Wants to have read access to Alice’s photos
    - Wants to know where it should put its facial detection data
    - Wants to have read access to Bob’s photos that Alice has access to
 - Alice accidentally uses https://evilfitbit.example to track her fitness data
    - Evilfitbit will try to do everything to get Alice’s financial data while pretending to just track her fitness data (This should not be allowed)
 - Alice uses https://financeTracker.example to view her current finances
    - financeTracker wants to be able to read Alice’s Financial data
    - financeTracker wants to be able to keep a backup of Alice’s data
    - Alice wants to ensure that financeTracker isn’t legally allowed to save the data it receives
 - Alice uses https://favoriteRestaurants.example to track the restaurants she likes
    - Favorite Restaurants wants to read and write data about restaurants and to get the Alice’s location
    - Alice only wants to allow Favorite Restaurants to read and write restaurant data but not to get her location
 - Alice uses https://blogs.example to read and write blogs
    - Blogs wants to be able to read public blog information and to write blog data to Alice’s Pod
    - Blogs wants to read data about Alice’s interests
    - Alice does not want Blogs to get data about her interests
    - Blogs continually asks Alice to grant it access to her interests and Alice is annoyed with the incessant asking
 - Alice uses, is developing, or is testing an app deployed to http://localhost:8080
    - Note that Alice's Identity Provider can't reach Alice's `localhost:8080`
    - Note that Alice's Pod can't reach Alice's `localhost:8080`
 - Alice uses an app deployed behind a NAT or firewall (while her browser is also behind the same NAT or firewall) that accesses resources outside the NAT or firewall; for example, Alice uses https://coolcode.int.enterprise.example to edit code stored in Customer Bob's Pod
    - *CoolCode* is deployed behind Enterprise.Example's company firewall and is not dereferenceable from the outside, for example because
      - *CoolCode* is proprietary to Enterprise.Example; or
      - *CoolCode* is a commercial product that is deployed on-premises at Enterprise.Example's datacenter
    - Note that Alice's Identity Provider can't reach https://coolcode.int.enterprise.example
    - Note that Customer Bob's Pod can't reach https://coolcode.int.enterprise.example
 - Alice uses https://photoOrganizer.example to organize photos on her company's private storage server https://storage.private.enterprise.example
    - `storage.private.enterprise.example`'s TLS certificate is signed by Enterprise.Example's private Certificate Authority
    - Alice's web browser is configured to trust Enterprise.Example's private Certificate Authority
    - `storage.private.enterprise.example` is reachable from the public Internet, so Alice's Identity Provider and *photoOrganizer* could reach it; however, neither is configured to trust Enterprise.Example's private Certificate Authority
